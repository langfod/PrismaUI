## Contributing Guide

- Use `dev` branch for your pull requests.
- Feel free to contribute to this project.

## Development

### Requirements

- [CMake](https://cmake.org/) 4.1+
- [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/) (recommended build system)
- [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/) with `VCPKG_ROOT` environment variable set
- Visual Studio 2022 with C++23 support
- C++23 Compiler (MSVC)
- [Ultralight SDK](https://ultralig.ht/download) 1.4.1-dev
  - Place the archive "ultralight-free-sdk-1.4.1-dev-win-x64.7z" in the "external" folder.

### Runtime Requirements

End users must install the Address Library matching their Skyrim executable. PrismaUI does not bundle or fall back to
an address database. It loads the standard file from `Data/SKSE/Plugins`:

- Skyrim SE: `version-<runtime>.bin`
- Skyrim AE: `versionlib-<runtime>.bin`
- Skyrim VR: `version-<runtime>.csv`

PrismaUI supports Address Library binary formats 1, 2, and 5 plus the VR CSV format. A matching database is necessary
but does not by itself guarantee compatibility: the runtime must also have a validated PrismaUI ABI profile. Unknown
runtime layouts fail during plugin loading before hooks are installed.

### Getting Started

```bat
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/PrismaUI-SKSE/PrismaUI.git
cd PrismaUI
```

### Build with CMake

#### Quick Build (Recommended)

Use the helper script to build with optimal settings:

```powershell
# Release build (default)
.\BuildRelease.ps1

# Debug build
.\BuildRelease.ps1 -preset debug

# Customize thread count
.\BuildRelease.ps1 -preset release -threads 4
```

> ***Note:*** The script automatically launches the VS Developer Shell and configures the build environment.

#### Manual Build

If you prefer manual CMake commands:

```bat
# Configure (from VS Developer Command Prompt)
cmake -S . --preset=release

# Build
cmake --build --preset=release --parallel 8
```

Available presets: `debug`, `release`

### Build Output

- **DLL Output**: `build/release/bin/PrismaUI.dll`
- **Distribution Package**: `dist/PrismaUI_<version>/` (created automatically after build)

### Upgrading Packages (Optional)

**vcpkg:**

```bat
vcpkg upgrade
```
